# Cyber-Search-Shortcuts
Browser Shortcuts for Cyber Security Related Online Services

## The Idea

I use browser search shortcuts for many different platforms (internal and external) and would like to share some very useful ones with you. They speed up online lookups and thus your whole analysis process. This repository lists well-known public services that allow you to use such search queries. If you use a certain site/service that you cannot find in our list, please add it and provide a pull request on this README.md file.  

## Setup

Modern browsers feature custom search engines, to which you can add new entries. Simply look for "Manage search engines" in you browser settings. Using the shortcuts you can then just open a new tab, type that shortcut and paste your search. 

### Chrome, Brave, Chromium

### Firefox

In Firefox create a bookmark with one of the URLs containing that `%s` placeholder, edit that bookmark, assign a keyword and save it to make it usable in the search bar.

### Demo

It's usually just a CTRL+T, Shortcut, CTRL+V and ENTER to get a result. Super fast and comfortable.
